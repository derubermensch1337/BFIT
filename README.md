# BFIT

Beer Fridge Inventory Tracking (BFIT) is a system that logs who takes drinks from a fridge, how much they consume, and provides statistics on current stock and usage.
The project was developed as part of the DTU course **34338 – Telecommunication Programming Project with Arduino**.

This repository contains the embedded code, server/backend logic, documentation, and supporting files for the project.

## Features
- RFID-based user authentication
- Automatic detection of items removed using scale
- Servo-controlled locking mechanism
- Local web server displaying usage and inventory data
- User and inventory database
